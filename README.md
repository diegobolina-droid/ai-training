## Choose Your Language

All labs are available in **Python** and **TypeScript**. Choose based on your preference:

| Aspect | Python | TypeScript |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Directory | `labs/labXX/python/` | `labs/labXX/typescript/` |
| Web Framework | FastAPI | Hono |
| Validation | Pydantic | Zod |
| Run Command | `uvicorn main:app` | `npm run dev` |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```bash
cd /path/to/AI_Training
```

### 2. Setup Your Language

<details>
<summary><b>Python Setup</b></summary>

```bash
# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>TypeScript Setup</b></summary>

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# For individual labs
cd labs/lab02-code-analyzer-agent/typescript
npm install
```

</details>

### 3. Configure API Keys
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### 4. Verify Setup

Run the universal setup verification script:

```bash
# Verify all environments (Python + TypeScript)
./scripts/verify-setup.sh

# Verify Python only
./scripts/verify-setup.sh python

# Verify TypeScript only
./scripts/verify-setup.sh typescript
```

The script checks versions, API keys, and installed packages for your chosen language.
